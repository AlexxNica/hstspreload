This repo contains the script that's used to update Chromium's HSTS preloading.

The HSTS data itself is kept in net/base/transport_security_state_static.[json|certs] (in the Chromium repo) and is shared with Firefox. At checkin-time, the JSON is converted into a C++ header file for compilation into the binary.

This script is the code that does the conversion. It doesn't live in the Chromium repo because it's Go code, which is not an official language for Chromium.
